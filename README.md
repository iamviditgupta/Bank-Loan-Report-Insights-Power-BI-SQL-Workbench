**Title: Loan Insights Dashboard**

**Description:**

This repository contains the code and resources for a comprehensive loan insights dashboard project. The goal of this project is to leverage data visualization techniques using Power BI and MySQL to analyze and present key metrics and insights related to bank loans.

Tools Used:
Power BI: Used for creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards to display loan-related metrics such as total applications, funded amounts, interest rates, DTI ratios, and loan statuses.

MySQL: Utilized for data storage, retrieval, and analysis. SQL queries were used to fetch and process loan data from the database for visualization in Power BI.

**Functions and Features:**
Total Loan Applications: Calculated the total number of loan applications received during specific periods and analyzed trends over time.

Funded Amount Analysis: Visualized the total amount of funds disbursed as loans and monitored changes month-over-month (MoM).

Payment Received Tracking: Tracked the total amount received from borrowers to assess cash flow and loan repayment trends.

Average Interest Rate and DTI: Calculated and monitored the average interest rate and debt-to-income ratio (DTI) for borrowers to gauge financial health.

Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs: Developed key performance indicators (KPIs) to differentiate between good and bad loans based on application percentage, funded amounts, and total received amounts.

Loan Status Grid View: Created a comprehensive grid view report categorized by loan status, providing insights into loan performance metrics.

**Recommendations and Changes:**
Recommendations for Users: Users can utilize the dashboard to gain actionable insights into loan portfolio health, borrower profiles, and loan performance. They can make informed decisions regarding lending operations, risk assessment, and portfolio management.

Potential Changes: Future enhancements could include adding predictive analytics models for default prediction, integrating real-time data feeds for dynamic reporting, and expanding dashboard functionalities for deeper drill-down analysis.

This repository aims to provide a user-friendly and informative platform for analyzing and understanding bank loan data, empowering users to make data-driven decisions and optimize lending strategies.
